# What's Kadabra?

Kadabra is a state-of-the-art AI which plays the Pokemon video game
competitively.

Well, that's the idea. Right now, Kadabra is a README.md file.

# Why is it called Kadabra?

I was going to call it Alakazam because it's really smart. But that seemed
presumptuous, since it's going to be bad for a long time. Hence, Kadabra.

# Can I use it?

No, it's not really usable yet.
